/*:
 Each image is exactly 400 pixels wide by 600 pixels tall. 
 
 Your goal is to precisely reproduce this image: 
 
 ![subhumans-no-grid](subhumans-no-grid.png "Subhumans")
 ![subhumans-with-grid](subhumans-with-grid.png "Subhumans")

 By precisely reproducing this image, you will demonstrate your understanding of:
 
 * sequence (order of statements in a program)
 * conditionals (making decisions with ``if`` statements)
 * iteration (use of loops to repeat statements)
 * arrays (a list of related objects or values)
 
 You may use the color constants created below to obtain the correct colors.
 
 Remember that you can refer to the [Canvas class documentation](https://www.russellgordon.ca/canvasgraphics/documentation/classes/canvas), as needed.

 ## Use Source Control
 
 As this is a practice task, there is no hard deadline. However, completing this practice task – an assessment for learning – prior to attempting an assessment of learning – is strongly recommended.
 
 Be sure to commit your work multiple times as you make progress on completing this task.
